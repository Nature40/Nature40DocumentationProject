It consists of industry standard components.                             Battery Box with typical installation               Switching scheme  The battery box has a very simple design. Besides the cabling, it contains a solar charge regulator, a fuse panel for the protection of the consumers and an AGM 120aH battery.

The “Wham Bam Box” made of recycled PP plastic was chosen for its extreme mechanical strength and almost complete biochemical resistance. The bad temperature spectrum for thermal stability is from approx. -10 -140 °C., it is acid and alkali resistant and waterproof.

Mounting details inside of the box (left) and outside of the box (right)       Station setup in the field  For safe operation, the following points must be taken into account when setting up the box:  1.) The box must be placed horizontally. Preferable at on a clearing to reduce impacts of falling branches or similar.                       2.) One square meter around the box must be cleared of any vegetation and the A-horizon (depending on the slope, even more).                       3.) Around this area a further strip with a diameter of at least 1 meter must also be cleared of organic material, especially leaves. Dig up the A-horizon and exclude roots and organic stuff. Note that the wiring sections must also be cleared of combustible organic material.                       4.) Check cables and screws for proper seating and integrity.                       5.) Check proper installation of the solar panel. Mount the panel on a simple wooden slat attached to the frame to avoid damage to the protective foil on the back. Such damage will destroy the panel.                       6.) Attach the solar connectors to the panel. This avoids ground contact and provides good weather protection. This can be done very easily by threading cable ties through the plugs and the junction box.                       7.) Finally, the box should be secured against unauthorized or accidental opening. For this purpose there is a steel cable with a number lock, which is to be attached in the way it is placed there.                       Final check    All contacts and cables must be checked for proper seating and integrity. Especially the charging cables on the battery must be screwed tightly.   All cables are to be laid without tension.   The solar cables are to be laid separately to avoid a short circuit, so that an animal crossing etc. does not cause them to come into contact.   The box is secured and tight.   Risk Assessment Here you find the preliminary risk assesment for the installation and operation of 12 V solar power based energy supply units and measuring sensor systems. ">

Mounting details inside of the box (left) and outside of the box (right)  Station setup in the fieldFor safe operation, the following points must be taken into account when setting up the box:1.) The box must be placed horizontally. Preferable at on a clearing to reduce impacts of falling branches or similar.            2.) One square meter around the box must be cleared of any vegetation and the A-horizon (depending on the slope, even more).            3.) Around this area a further strip with a diameter of at least 1 meter must also be cleared of organic material, especially leaves. Dig up the A-horizon and exclude roots and organic stuff. Note that the wiring sections must also be cleared of combustible organic material.            4.) Check cables and screws for proper seating and integrity.            5.) Check proper installation of the solar panel. Mount the panel on a simple wooden slat attached to the frame to avoid damage to the protective foil on the back. Such damage will destroy the panel.            6.) Attach the solar connectors to the panel. This avoids ground contact and provides good weather protection. This can be done very easily by threading cable ties through the plugs and the junction box.            7.) Finally, the box should be secured against unauthorized or accidental opening. For this purpose there is a steel cable with a number lock, which is to be attached in the way it is placed there.            Final check  All contacts and cables must be checked for proper seating and integrity. Especially the charging cables on the battery must be screwed tightly.  All cables are to be laid without tension.  The solar cables are to be laid separately to avoid a short circuit, so that an animal crossing etc. does not cause them to come into contact.  The box is secured and tight.Risk AssessmentHere you find the preliminary risk assesment for the installation and operation of 12 V solar power based energy supply units and measuring sensor systems.">
