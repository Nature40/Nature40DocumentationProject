It largely consists of components according to industry standards.

The following points must be taken into account when setting up the box:  1) The box must be placed horizontally. Preferable at on a clearing to reduce impacts of falling branches etc..                       2) at a distance of the box height, approx. 1 square metre must be cleared of any vegetation and the A-horizon (depending on the slope, even more)                       3) Around this area a further strip of at least 1 metre wide must also be cleared of organic material, especially leaves (using e.g. a leaf broom)                       4) Dig up the A-horizon (left) and clean it completely from roots and organic stuff (right).

Fix at least simple wooden slats to the allu frame to avoid damage to the protective foil on the back. Such damage will destroy the panel!                        7) Attach the solar connectors to the panel. This avoids ground contact and provides good weather protection. This can be done very easily by threading cable ties through the plugs and the junction box.                        8) Finally, the box should be secured against unauthorized or accidental opening.
