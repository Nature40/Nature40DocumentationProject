The GW-Hub is a *light* version of the *planet* sensor box

The Spelsberg TK PC Box has the ingress protection IP66 - acc. EN 60529 / DIN VDE 0470-1 and an ambient temperature from -35 °C min. to 80 °C max. Due to it's UV resistancy, weatherproof and a rated insulation voltage 690V AC the box is fitting for outdoor application. 

### Hardware Installation

The Powercon build-in-socket is embedded by drilling a counterbore (25mm) and 2x M3 Screws placed at the sockets corners. The attached Protective Cap seals the drilling against outside influences like water and dirt. 

To ensure the box to be waterproof the drilled holes should be agglutinated with silicone between the washer and the screws. 


The [DC/DC](https://www.lightinthebox.com/de/p/iztoss-doppel-usb-auto-wandlermodul-12v-3a-15w-netzteil-5v_p4852571.html) down stepper converter as well as the [Wemos 18650 battery shield](https://www.ebay.de/itm/Raspberry-Pi-Wemos-18650-Battery-Shield-V3-ESP32-For-Arduino-With-Free-USB-Cable-/272899859849) and the [GW1000](http://www.foshk.com/Wifi_Weather_Station/GW1000.html) are simply fixed in the box with velcro and wired like on the photo below.  

The radiation shield is set on a waterproof cable entry and fixed with two srcews. Note you have to put in the sensor firs then close the cable entry and then fix the shield.
