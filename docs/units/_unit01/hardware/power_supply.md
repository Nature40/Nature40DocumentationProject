The power supply box is designed to safely supply a range of demanding energy consumers with power. It consists of industry standard components.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/top_box.jpg" alt="Battery box with typical installation" caption="Battery Box with typical installation" %}

## Switching scheme

The battery box has a very simple design. Besides the cabling, it contains a solar charge regulator, a fuse panel for the protection of the consumers and an AGM 120aH battery.

## Components
* Sealable, durable Wham Bam Heavy Duty Box, 62 L, 59,5 x 40 x 37 cm, PP Recycling Plastic [Wham Bam Box](https://www.whatmoreuk.com/product/wham-bam-62l-h-duty-box-lid-black-recycled/). The "Wham Bam Box" made of recycled PP plastic was chosen for its extreme mechanical strength and almost complete biochemical resistance. The bad temperature spectrum for thermal stability is from approx. -10 -140 °C., it is acid and alkali resistant and waterproof. By additionally equipping the box with a fire protection mat, the almost airtight closure offers a virtually complete reduction of fire load inside and outside the box.

## Station setup in the field

For safe operation, the following points must be taken into account when setting up the box:

1.) The box must be placed horizontally. Preferable at on a clearing to reduce impacts of falling branches or similar.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/0_raw_installation.jpg" alt="The box must be placed horizontally."  %}

2.) One square meter around the box must be cleared of any vegetation and the A-horizon (depending on the slope, even more).
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/01_cleaning area_from_organic_material.jpg" alt="Cleaning box area and cable transects from organic material."  %}

3.) Around this area a further strip with a diameter of at least 1 meter must also be cleared of organic material, especially leaves. Dig up the A-horizon and exclude roots and organic stuff. Note that the wiring sections must also be cleared of combustible organic material.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/02_cleaning_box_plot_from_vegetation.jpg" alt="Clearing box area from vegetation and roots."  %}

4.) Check cables and screws for proper seating and integrity.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/06_check_cables.jpg" alt="Check cables and screws for proper seating and integrity."  %}

5.) Check proper installation of the solar panel. Mount the panel on a simple wooden slat attached to the frame to avoid damage to the protective foil on the back. Such damage will destroy the panel.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/06_simple_rack.jpg" alt="Check proper installation of the solar panel."  %}

6.) Attach the solar connectors to the panel. This avoids ground contact and provides good weather protection. This can be done very easily by threading cable ties through the plugs and the junction box.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/07_solar_plugs.jpg" alt="Attach the solar connectors to the panel."  %}

7.) Finally, the box should be secured against unauthorized or accidental opening. For this purpose there is a steel cable with a number lock, which is to be attached in the way it is placed there.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/08_safety_cable.jpg" alt="Secure box against unauthorized or accidental opening."  %}

## Final check
1. All contacts and cables must be checked for proper seating and integrity. Especially the charging cables on the battery must be screwed tightly.
1. All cables are to be laid without tension.
1. The solar cables are to be laid separately to avoid a short circuit, so that an animal crossing etc. does not cause them to come into contact.
1. The box is secured and tight.
