The power supply box is designed to safely supply a range of demanding energy consumers with power. It largely consists of components according to industry standards. Especially the mechanical strength as well as the high water and gas tightness and the possibility to integrate 2 * 120Ah lead gel batteries were essential prerequisites for the design. 

The box contains up to 4 current drain plugs and has one lead to each solar panel. The typical installation is set up in a PP-Container Box that is capable of two 120Ah AGM Batteries and the necessary electric and electronic items.

## Switching scheme

The battery box has a very simple design. Besides the cabling, it contains a solar charge regulator, 2A panel for the protection of the outgoing consumers and an AGM 120aH battery

## Components

Please note that the data sheets are not always available. For the specific purchased components they are linked. The not linked components like cables etc. are common industry standard products

- Sealable, durable box
	- Wham Bam Heavy Duty Box, 62 L, 59,5 x 40 x 37 cm
	PP Recycling Plastic [Wham Bam Box](https://www.whatmoreuk.com/product/wham-bam-62l-h-duty-box-lid-black-recycled/)

 - The "Wham Bam Box" made of recycled PP plastic was chosen for its extreme mechanical strength and almost complete biochemical resistance. The bad temperature spectrum for thermal stability is from approx. -10 -140 °C., it is acid and alkali resistant and waterproof. By additionally equipping the box with a fire protection mat, the almost airtight closure offers a virtually complete reduction of fire load inside and outside the box.

## Station setup in the field

or safe operation of the box, the following points must be followed. In particular, the influence of vegetation by combustible organic materials and broken branches must be carefully excluded. The following points must be taken into account when setting up the box:

**1) The box must be placed horizontally. Preferable at on a clearing to reduce impacts of falling branches etc..**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/0_raw_installation.jpg" alt="The box must placed horizontally"  %}


**2) at a distance of the box height, approx. 1 square metre must be cleared of any vegetation and the A-horizon (depending on the slope, even more)**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/01_cleaning area_from_organic_material.jpg" alt="Cleaning box area and cable transects from organic material"  %}


**3) Around this area a further strip of at least 1 metre wide must also be cleared of organic material, especially leaves (using e.g. a leaf broom)**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/02_cleaning _box_plot_from_vegetation.jpg" alt="Cleaning box area from vegetation and roots"  %}


**4) Dig up the A-horizon (left) and clean it completely from roots and organic stuff (right). Take care that the wiring sections must also be cleared of combustible organic material**
{% include gallery id="panel3"   layout ="half"  %}

**5) Check cables and screws for proper seating and integrity**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/06_check_cables.jpg" alt="Check cables and screws for proper seating and integrity"  %}

**6) Check proper installation of the solar panel. Fix at least simple wooden slats to the allu frame to avoid damage to the protective foil on the back. Such damage will destroy the panel!**

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/06_simple_rack.jpg" alt="Check proper installation of the solar panel"  %}


**7) Attach the solar connectors to the panel. This avoids ground contact and provides good weather protection. This can be done very easily by threading cable ties through the plugs and the junction box.**

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/07_solar_plugs.jpg" alt="Attach the solar connectors to the panel"  %}

**8) Finally, the box should be secured against unauthorized or accidental opening. For this purpose there is a steel cable with a number lock, which is to be attached in the way it is placed there.**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/battery_box/08_safety_cable.jpg" alt="Secure box against unauthorized or accidental opening"  %}

### Final check
Please check that:

1. all contacts and cables must be checked for proper seating and integrity. Especially the charging cables on the battery must be screwed tightly.
1. all cables are to be laid without tension
1. the solar cables are to be laid separately to avoid a short circuit, so that even a animal crossing etc. does not cause them to come into contact.
1. the box ist secured and tight
