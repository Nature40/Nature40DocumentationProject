These pages you will find information about the third-party sensors in use. For a description of the sensors and how they work, please refer to the manufacturer's pages.  


In the current state, the sensor system consists of the following third-party sensor systems:

* [TreeTalker +](https://www.nature4.org/technology): TreeTalker monitors: Water transport inside the plant, diameter growth, quantity and quality of foliage (light transmission in 12 spectral bands, temperature, humidity, tree stability, the data is transmitted via radio 

* [Fine Offset](http://www.foshk.com/): Weather and environmental sensors. The sensors from Fine Offset are rebranded and partly modified by the resellers. We currently use sensors from [froggit DP-series](https://www.froggit.de/?cat=c40_DP-Serie-dp-serie.html) and [ecowitt GW-1000 series](http://www.ecowitt.com/wifi_weather/80.html). 


## Open Source

These Sensors are commercial hardware. However we are implementing an open data policy with open source interfaces to obtain and deliver the data streams.
