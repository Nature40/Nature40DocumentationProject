# Purpose
The documentation provides information on
* sensor constructions and setups
* communication pathways and data workflows


# Nature 4.0 - Sensing Biodiversity

The aim of LOEWE's Nature4.0 project is to develop a prototype of Nature 4.0, a modular environmental monitoring system for high-resolution observation of species, habitats and processes relevant to nature conservation. Natur4.0 is based on the combination of expert knowledge and networked remote sensing and environmental sensors, which are attached to stationary and mobile platforms such as trees, UAVs, moving robots and animals. Together with powerful data integration and data analysis methods, Nature4.0 enables the differentiated and effective observation of landscapes.
