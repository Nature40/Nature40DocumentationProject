(Bill 2016)Data ModelsThe basis for the reduction of information is formed by so-called data models. A data model is formed by the abstraction of individual objects (entities) and their properties (attributes).

Both data models are principally usable for the representation of continuous properties as well as discrete geo objects. In practice, however, continuous data is usually mapped in the raster data model and discrete data in vector data format. Please note that the mentioned data models can not only be used for the representation of time-definite characteristic values, but also for time-varying characteristics.Vector data modelIn a Cartesian coordinate system, which is necessary for the representation of a Euclidean geometry, arbitrarily complex spatial structures for the modeling of geoobjects can be constructed from the basic element point.              Vector data model basic concept.

If we have referenced two nodes in the coordinate system, we can connect these nodes by a line topologically called an edge.If not only two nodes are connected by an edge, but as a result of the connection of at least three nodes by edges a closed surface arises, we speak of a polygon or topologically of a mesh. In GI systems, nodes are usually referred to as points, non-closed connections of edges as lines, and meshes as polygons.Raster data modelUnlike the vector data model, in raster data models, space is always mapped using two- or three-dimensional objects in any shape and size, but without overlapping or gaps.

<p>In school, you have come to know such points as vectors, and in geo-informatics and the topological context of geography, one speaks of knots. If we have referenced two nodes in the coordinate system, we can connect these nodes by a line topologically called an edge.</p>

<p>If not only two nodes are connected by an edge, but as a result of the connection of at least three nodes by edges a closed surface arises, we speak of a polygon or topologically of a mesh. In GI systems, nodes are usually referred to as points, non-closed connections of edges as lines, and meshes as polygons.</p>

<h3 id="raster-data-model">Raster data model</h3>

<p>Unlike the vector data model, in raster data models, space is always mapped using two- or three-dimensional objects in any shape and size, but without overlapping or gaps. The characteristic values are stored as numerical values assigned to each cell.</p>

<p>Arranging the non-intersecting cells in rows and columns creates an implicit spatial reference of each cell. It should be noted that the origin of a raster image always lies in the upper left corner and is usually counted from there by the two run indices i, j. As a result, each pixel is uniquely identifiable. In this way, an explicit spatial reference is available with respect to each pixel.</p>

<p>However, this explicit spatial concept is not yet located in a defined Cartesian coordinate system or in the real world. This location is necessary both for the joint use of raster data with vector data, as well as essential for the geographical referencing of the raster cells with respect to the real world. Therefore, raster data models are basically also provided with a Cartesian coordinate system. However, this has the origin (as usual) in the lower left corner. The grid cells can therefore be identified both by their index and by the Cartesian coordinate system in space.</p>
