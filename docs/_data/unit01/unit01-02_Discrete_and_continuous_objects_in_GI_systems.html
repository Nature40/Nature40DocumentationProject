<meta name="description" content="Objects and spaceHow do we most easily and efficiently implement the abstraction of our worldview in geography? In principle, the geographical representation of space can be carried out using two different concepts: On the one hand, unique objects can be identified, so-called discrete geo-objects. Opposed to this is the concept of continuous spaces or fields. In principle, discrete (geo) objects are anything that can be delimited and counted in any way. So, for example Cars, houses, pedestrians, flowers, bears, football fields and so on.
